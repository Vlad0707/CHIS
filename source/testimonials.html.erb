	<h2> THIS IS WHAT CUSTOMERS SAY ABOUT US </h2>
	<p>
		The quality of the work performed by California Home Improvement Solutions (CHIS) was excellent.  They exceeded my expectations in all regards. 
		<br></br>
		I contracted CHIS to repair the back wall fo my house that had a large amount of dry rot.  Leo and his team were able to quickly assess the damage, then required repairs, purchase all needed materials at cost, and complete the work in a very timely nanner.  The finished work is better than the original and will last countless years to come.  
		<br></br>
		Leo and his team were very helpful and easy to work with.  I felt a very high degree of confidence from the team and their work was impeccable.  The work site was always left thoroughly organized and tidy.  Leo was extremely helpful especially in his selection and procurement of the needed materials.  
		<br></br>
		CHIS provided excellent value for my money.  All materials were purchased and provided at cost.  The entire project fit right into my expected budget.  There were no overages or unexpected surprises at all.  I can't recommend California Home Improvement highly enough.  
		<br></br>
		I have done many home improvement projects in the past and CHIS is by far the best experience I've ever had.  CHIS works on solid principals of ethics from the quality of the team, the work performed, and the outstanding customer service.  I plan to do additional projects with them in the future.  I am 100%+ satisfied customer.
